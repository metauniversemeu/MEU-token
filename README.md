Meta Universe MEU Token
MEU is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain.
It represents a seed of value and long-term vision, designed to foster community, creativity, and new forms of utility.

MEU was created without pre-sale, without taxes, and without any private investors.
No liquidity was extracted from the project, and the initial liquidity was provided personally by its creator — ensuring full transparency and decentralization.

Initial Liquidity and Launch Process
On June 19, 2025, an initial liquidity pool was first created on Uniswap V4, but due to technical adjustments and pricing errors, that pool was later closed.

On June 20, 2025, a new liquidity pool was successfully launched on Uniswap V3 with an initial contribution of 0.40 ETH.

All technical steps were carried out patiently and directly by the project’s creator.

A first wave of small holders joined organically after confirming that everything was functioning correctly.
